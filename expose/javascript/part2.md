## Part 1: A Little More of a Challenge
# Question 1
At line 12, 3 is printed onto the console because it prints the index of the final iteration before exiting the loop, which is 3.

# Question 2
At line 13, 150 is printed onto the console because the loop runs until the end of the list and the last discounted price in the list is 150

# Question 3
At line 14, 150 is printed onto the console because the loop runs until the end of the list and the last discounted price in the list is 150. The final price in the list is 150.

# Question 4
Since we are not printing anything to the console, nothing is printed onto the console. There are no errors thrown either. 

# Question 5
Line 12 throws a runtime error because i is declared within the for loop block. Since we are calling it outside of that block, it cannot be accessed.

# Question 6
Line 13 throws a runtime error because discountedPrice is declared within the for loop block. Since we are calling it outside of that block, it cannot be accessed.

# Question 7
Line 14 prints 150, the final price discounted. Since final price is declared in the same block as the console print statement, there are no errors and the variable can be accessed.

# Question 8
Since we are not printing anything to the console, nothing is printed onto the console. There are no errors thrown either. 

# Question 9
Line 11 will cause an error because i is declared within the for loop block. Since we are calling it outside of that block, it cannot be accessed.

# Question 10
Line 12 will print 3 since that is the length of the prices array and it has not been changed.

# Question 11
Since we are not printing anything to the console, nothing is printed onto the console. There are no errors thrown either. 

# Question 12
A. student.name
B. student['Grad Year']
C. student.greeting();
D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
C. student.courseLoad[0]

# Question 13
A. '32' since integers map to their exact string representation
B. 1 since '3' converts to an integer for integer operation
C. 3 since null maps to 0
D. '3null' since null maps to string representation
E. 4 since true maps to 1
F. 0 since false and null map to 0
G. '3undefined' since undefined maps to string representation
H. NaN since 3 - undefined is undefined

# Question 14
A. true since 2 is greater than 1 and '2' is changed to integer
B. false since by string comparison, '1' comes before '2'
C. true since '2' changes to integer
D. false since 2 and '2' are different types
E. false since true is 1
F. true since Boolean(2) is also true

# Question 15
== checks if the values are equal even if the types are different. === checks if the values are exactly the same, including the type.

# Question 17
The function modifyArray took in the array [1,2,3]. It created a new array and doubled each value in the input array and pushed it to the new array. The doSomething function doubles the value of each number and the loop allows each number in the input array to be modified and put into the new array. [2,4,6] is returned.
